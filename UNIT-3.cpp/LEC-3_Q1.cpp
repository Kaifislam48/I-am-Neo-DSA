/* You are tasked with implementing a ticketing system for a concert event using a queue using a linked list data structure. 



The program should store ticket numbers in a queue and display them in a zigzag pattern. The program should prompt the user to enter the capacity of the ticket queue and allow them to enqueue ticket numbers until they enter -1 to stop. After enqueueing, the program should display the ticket numbers in the zigzag pattern.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a single integer representing the capacity of the ticket queue.

The next line contains a sequence of integers representing the ticket numbers to enqueue.

The sequence should end with -1 to stop enqueueing.

Output format :
The output prints the ticket numbers stored in the queue, displayed in a zigzag pattern.

Code constraints :
The ticket numbers must be positive integers.

The capacity of the queue should be a positive integer.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
10 20 30 40 50 -1
Output 1 :
10 50 20 40 30 
Input 2 :
8
11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 -1
Output 2 :
11 88 22 77 33 66 44 55  */
