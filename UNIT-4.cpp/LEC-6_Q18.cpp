/* Joseph is learning about binary trees and post-order traversals in his computer science class.



He is given an assignment to write a program that constructs the post-order traversal of a binary tree from a list of integers. Can you help him solve this problem?

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of integers Joseph will provide to construct the binary tree.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the values of the nodes in the binary tree.

Output format :
The output displays a single line containing n space-separated integers, representing the post-order traversal of the binary tree.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 <= n <= 20

1 <= elements <= 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 3 4 5 2
Output 1 :
5 2 3 4 1 
Input 2 :
5
1 7 9 5 6
Output 2 :
5 6 7 9 1  */
