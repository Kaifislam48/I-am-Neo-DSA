/* 
Rithish is studying data structures and algorithms, and he's currently learning about binary search trees (BSTs). He wants to practice his skills by performing operations on a BST. Help him by designing a program that allows him to insert elements into a BST and perform two operations: post-order traversal and calculating the height of the tree.



Note:

The height of the tree is computed by finding the maximum height between the left and right subtrees of the root node and then adding 1 to that maximum height.

Input format :
The first line of input is an integer n, representing the number of elements to be inserted into the BST.

The second line of input is an integer, where the i-th integer represents the value to be inserted into the BST.

Output format :
The output displays the following format:



First, it should print "Post-order traversal: " followed by the post-order traversal of the BST.

Then, it should print "Height of the tree: " followed by the height of the BST.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 <= n <= 20

1 <= i <= 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
7
100 50 200 10 60 150 300
Output 1 :
Post-order traversal: 10 60 50 150 300 200 100 
Height of the tree: 2 */
